We develop a new special relativistic hydrodynamics module that robustly handles flows spanning ultra-relativistic to non-relativistic regimes. The solver supports Lorentz factors as high as $10^6$, incorporates adaptive mesh refinement, mitigates catastrophic floating-point cancellation, and achieves high GPU performance with excellent scalability to over 2,000 GPUs.
